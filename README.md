Golang API and TouchOSC layouts for controlling Avid™ VENUE software

This software package is designed to enable audio engineers to control an Avid™
VENUE system using a mobile device. The initial version is focused on the
workflow of a monitoring engineer needing to quickly set and maintain levels
for multiple monitor mixes, while having the freedom to stand on the stage with
the performers while doing so.

Although an engineer can always use a VNC client to perform this function,
doing so is cumbersome due to the small UI elements and lack of design for
mobile usage. This software should make that easier.

* 2015-06-23: Initial checkin. The software is not yet ready for general usage.
  Only very basic channel selection and send level adjustments are working.
